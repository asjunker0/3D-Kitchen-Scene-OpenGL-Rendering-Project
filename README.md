# 3D-Kitchen-Scene-OpenGL-Rendering-Project
This project showcases a 3D kitchen scene built with OpenGL. It includes custom object modeling, texture mapping, lighting using the Phong reflection model, and camera navigation controls. The scene demonstrates an understanding of 3D transformations, shader programming, and modular code design.
