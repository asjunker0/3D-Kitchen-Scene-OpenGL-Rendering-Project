# 3D-Kitchen-Scene-OpenGL-Rendering-Project
CS 320: Software Test, Automation
<br/>
<br/>(From the SNHU CS-330 Syllabus)
<br/>Students will create realistic, interactive, three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices. Students will also develop fully formed graphic applications that meet project requirements.

# Course Competencies
This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to the field:
<br/>CS-30418: Generate accurate representations of three-dimensional objects using application programming interface libraries and computer graphics development best practices
<br/>CS-30419: Create interactive graphics applications that respond to input devices
<br/>CS-30420: Develop a fully formed three-dimensional project that meets project requirements

# Software and Tools
<br/>Visual Studio 2022: Used as the main integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, organizing, compiling, and debugging the C++ project.
<br/>OpenGL: Used as the graphics API to render 3D shapes, textures, lighting, and camera movement within the scene.
<br/>GLM (OpenGL Mathematics Library): Used for managing transformations like scaling, rotation, translation, and matrix math.
<br/>C++: The primary programming language for building and customizing the 3D scene, implementing logic for materials, lights, and object rendering.
<br/>Custom Starter Project Files (provided by SNHU): Preconfigured templates that included the basic project structure, shader programs, and utility functions to speed up the development process.

# OpenGL Kitchen Project Overview
__Project Summary__<br/>
This project showcases a 3D kitchen scene built with OpenGL. It includes custom object modeling, texture mapping, lighting using the Phong reflection model, and camera navigation controls. The scene demonstrates an understanding of 3D transformations, shader programming, and modular code design.

__Designing Software__<br/>
When designing software, I break the project into manageable pieces and start with a clear visual idea. I focus on understanding the requirements, planning the structure, and thinking about what objects and systems are needed before building. For this project, I envisioned the story I wanted to tell first, then translated it into code step by step. It helped me strengthen my spatial reasoning and taught me to think about visual structure, lighting, and proportions, not just functionality. I built the kitchen scene by mapping out simple shapes, experimenting with textures and lights, and refining the layout through constant iteration.

__Developing Programs__<br/>
When developing programs, I start simple, build modularly, and test constantly to catch errors early. For this project, I leaned heavily into modularization by keeping transformations, materials, lights, and draw calls organized and reusable. I also embraced trial-and-error more than before, understanding that mistakes are part of building something visual. Iteration played a major role. I constantly adjusted object positioning, scaling, and lighting after viewing the results. Early in the milestones, I just focused on making things work, but by the end, I started writing cleaner, more reusable code and thinking ahead before making changes.

__Computer Science Goals__<br/>
Computer science helps me reach my goals by giving me the tools to create structured, working systems from ideas, moving me closer to a career in tech and creative problem-solving. This project specifically expanded my thinking beyond logic to also include spatial and visual design, making me feel more confident about tackling UI/UX, 3D modeling, and graphical programming projects in the future. Learning computational graphics also opened career paths like game development, simulations, VR/AR, and data visualization, where creativity and technical skills work together to solve real-world problems.
